#Specs

## General

I am planning on implementing an "Own project" as the project work. As specs for this type of project work need to be agreed by you, here they are:
Baseline requirements fulfilled as stated in the project work pdf.

Optional UI requirements: will be decided later after core functionality is there

Networking over REST API

I'll implement a subset of Producteev (task management cloud service) REST API interactions (https://www.producteev.com/api/doc/), specifically those parts of Tasks API that allow user to interact with tasks assigned to herself

## User stories

 * User can list her tasks (overview)
 * User can create a new task
 * User can view an existing task (specifics)
 * User can delete an existing task
 * User can update an existing task
 
So basically we are looking at a todo/task list app that is backed by Producteev service. Is the plan OK?
